This is an app that helps you answer Cluedo game.

Game info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo

It provides a sheet for answering the game, and help you analyze the
clues/evidence provided.

Use the table to tag users that have (or don't have) the evidence:
  * click once - black "✖" indicates that the evidence is not owned
    for this user
  * click twice - green "★" indicates that this evidence is owned
    for this user

  * click thrice - goes back to blank state

The counts under the table provides a summary of counts for each
evidence.
  * If the evidence is green "★", then it means this evidence is not relevant to the case.
  * If the evidence is red "6", then it means this one is the right evidence.

The investigation panel on the right provides a list/history of
investigations made by each players.
  * Investigated by: player that investigates
  * Suspect: guest suspected
  * Murder Item: item used in the murder (you don't say?!)
  * Room
  * Evidence from/gave by: player that was investigated and provides a
    card

This app still needs to be refined though. Will constantly update this
:)
